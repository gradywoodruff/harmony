# Harmony
Scripts that I use daily when working with Toonboom Harmony.

### Compatibility

```
ToonBoom Harmony Premium 16
```

## Scripts

**NC_AlignNodes.js**

> Aligns selected nodes horizontally or vertically in the Node View in Harmony.


**NC_CreateNotes.js**
> A one-click solution to creating a "notes" drawing layer that automatically connects to the main comp, sets up a visibility node so it won't render, and puts you in pencil mode ready to start drawing.

**NC_FindAndReplace.js**
> A quick find and replace UI that pre-populates with text 'asdf'. Big thank you to [Stylus Rumble](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7U2uqSXXcDCkMdqXsq_jQ) for the suggestion on having node templates named with 'asdf' to make it easy to rename!

**NC_Rename.js**
> Quick rename script - brings up a UI with the focus already in the field so you don't have to click anywhere with the mouse.

**NC_TweenUI.js**
> Creates a Simple UI for blending between two keyframes. Great when in stop motion mode!
